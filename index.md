## Hello, I'm Endy!

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist with a background in education. I'm currently in the Willamette University Masters of Data Science program and aim to graduate December 2025. Using my experience in education and non-profit work, I hope to continue serving vulnerable populations in the data science and ethics parts of these particular fields.

## Projects

[Data Visualization: A Proposal For Increased School Funding](pdf/Final Project .pdf)
<br><br>
Utilizing data from the Oregon Department of Education, my group partner and I looked at important education metrics in the state of Oregon. We explored and visualized the trends in graduation rates, state testing scores and teacher retention rates. Specific school districts, such as the Salem-Keizer school district, lagged behind its neighbors in those metrics. Throughout our project, we compiled a case and a proposal for increased school funding in order to see an improvement in graduation rates, testing scores and teacher retention rate.

[Survival Analysis: A Closer Look at the Longevity of Github Projects](/pdf/Github_Survival_Analysis.pdf)
<br><br>
Github is a vital part of open source software. Projects created on Github eventually "die" over time. This creates sustainability issues which threatens open source as a whole. My group partner and I created survival curves to understand the features that affect the longevity of Github projects. Through our survival curves, we learned that further analysis is needed to reach satisfying conclusions.

[Real Estate Sale Prices in Oregon: A First-Time Home Buyers' Guide](https://wu-msds-capstones.github.io/capstone-writeup-endy-and-brandon/)
<br><br>
The median age of first-time homeowners has been increasing at a rapid rate since COVID. Oregon's real estate market has been fluctuating, leaving buyers confused and out of the loop. Through data engineering and machine learning, my partner and I learned the indicators that determine the final sales price of homes in Oregon!

### In Progress
+ **Oregon County HDI:** How would Oregon look like if we created a Human Development Index for its counties? Which counties have the best metrics and which are lagging behind?
