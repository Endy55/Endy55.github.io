[Data Visualization: A Proposal For Increased School Funding](pdf/Final Project .pdf)
<br><br>
Utilizing data from the Oregon Department of Education, my group partner and I looked at important education metrics in the state of Oregon. We explored and visualized the trends in graduation rates, state testing scores and teacher retention rates. Specific school districts, such as the Salem-Keizer school district, lagged behind its neighbors in those metrics. Throughout our project, we compiled a case and a proposal for increased school funding in order to see an improvement in graduation rates, testing scores and teacher retention rate.
